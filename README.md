## Licensing

This project is part of the OpenClassrooms [Application developer - JavaScript React](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/516-developpeur-dapplication-javascript-react) course. The code is freely reusable, but the images / logo / figma [mock-up](https://www.figma.com/file/BMomGVZqLZb811mDMShpLu/UI-design-Sportify-FR?node-id=1%3A2) do not belong to me.

If you are also an OpenClassrooms student, you can freely draw inspiration from my work, but I obviously do not recommend copying parts of it.
